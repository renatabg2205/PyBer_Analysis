# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Pyber analysis:
The purpose of this project is to analyze all the rideshare data from PyBer -- a ride-sharing app company -- and create a compelling visualization for the CEO. The result will help the company to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

### Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4 running on Python 3.7.9

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Finally, youâ€™ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
