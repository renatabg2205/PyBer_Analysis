# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Pyber analysis:
The purpose of this project is to analyze all the rideshare data from PyBer -- a ride-sharing app company -- and create a compelling visualization for the CEO. The result will help the company to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

### Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4 running on Python 3.7.9

### A ride-sharing summary by city type
The summary below shows the total number of rides, total number of drivers, the total fares, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban).

The number of rides in rural cities is 5 times lower than the number of rides in the suburban cities and 13 times lower than the number of rides in the urban cities.

The number of drivers in rural cities is about 6.5 and 31 times lower than the number of drivers in the suburban and urban cities, respectively. 

If we compare the average fare per ride between each city type, we'll notice that the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $4 and $10 more per ride than the suburban and urban cities, respectively. Also, the average fare for drivers in the rural cities is about $16 and $39 more per driver than the suburban and urban cities, respectively. 


### Total weekly fares for each city type chart

The chart below shows the total fares for each week by city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban) between January and April 2019.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Finally, youâ€™ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
